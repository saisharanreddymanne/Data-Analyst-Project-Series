**Data Analyst Project Series**


**1. Data Exploration using SQL**

COVID-19 Data Exploration in Google BigQuery

**Project Overview**

This project explores COVID-19 data using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) BigQuery. The goal is to analyze and generate insights by combining multiple datasets related to COVID-19 cases and vaccinations. The project involves SQL-based data transformation, aggregation, and visualization-ready table creation.

**Tech Stack**

Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
BigQuery
SQL
Google Cloud Storage (if needed for data upload)


**Datasets Used:**

CovidDeaths - Contains information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and population statistics.
CovidVaccinations - Contains data on vaccinations administered worldwide.


**Key Operations Performed**
Data Cleaning & Transformation:
Filtering out NULL values for meaningful analysis.
Standardizing column data types (FLOAT64, STRING, INT64).

**2. 📊 COVID-19 Visualization Dashboard**

**Overview**

This Looker Studio dashboard provides an interactive visualization of COVID-19 data, including total cases, vaccinations, and death rates across different locations. The dashboard enables users to explore insights through filters and visual analytics.

**🔹Features**

✅ Global & Country-Level Analysis with map visualizations
✅ Key Metrics Display (Total Cases, Vaccinations, Death Rate, etc.)
✅ Interactive Filters (Continent, Country, Time Range)
✅ Trend Analysis (New Cases vs. New Vaccinations Over Time)

**3. Nashville Housing Data Cleaning with BigQuery**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on cleaning and transforming the Nashville Housing Dataset using Google BigQuery. It includes property details, sale prices, owner information, and other relevant attributes.

**Data Cleaning Steps**


The data underwent several cleaning and transformation processes, including standardizing unique identifiers, formatting sale prices, splitting address fields, and converting certain values to standardized formats.

**New Cleaned Table**

A new table was created in BigQuery to store the cleaned dataset.

**Exporting the Cleaned Data**

The cleaned dataset was downloaded from BigQuery and is ready for further use or sharing.
